# Toxicity Classifier

## Overview

The **Toxicity Classifier** is a web application built with React that leverages TensorFlow.js and the Toxicity model to identify whether a given text contains toxic content. The model detects various types of toxicity, such as threatening language, insults, obscenities, identity-based hate, or sexually explicit language. It is trained on the Civil Comments dataset, which contains approximately 2 million labeled comments for toxicity.

## Features

- Input any text and classify it for toxicity.
- Real-time predictions using the TensorFlow.js toxicity model.
- User-friendly interface with loading indicators and error handling.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Demo

You can check out a live demo of the application here: [Demo Link](#)

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
